# XLR Screwclip
Quick project because paying for screwclips in this economy makes no sense. Instead use a $1000 printer to do the job for five cents.

Print on the side with the loop facing towards the build plate. This allows the layers to run along the loop for flexability and durability.

For screws, I fitted this for 5mm head and 3mm body. Wood screws tend to work well because desks are made of..... wood, I guess.

## How I printed
- Prusa Mk4S
- .15mm Layer Height
- .4mm Nozzle
- Organic Supports
